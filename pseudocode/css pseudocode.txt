create file "character list" (probably based on folders in "characters")

read character list as array

in css scene:



create area2D that matches desired size of grid

for character in character list:
	create combination node that contains the character's icon and a reference to the character's scene
	add characterselect node to existing 3-column GridContainer
	if characterselect node is not inside area2D:
		disable characterselect node

if player cursor selects an icon:
	px_character = selected
	ready_check()

ready_check():
	if p1_character and p2_character != null:
		change_scene to main
		set round_start parameters

worry abt colors after
